Hi, 

**You Had Me at Hello World!**

I'm just your local friendly neighborhood Hansel. You know the one that loves the full stack development, datascience, automation, game dev, and communication / humanistic aspects of science and emerging tech? I'm also a huge extroverted human that also loves hiking, rock climbing, gaming, and often volunteers to contribute to projects for social good one commit at a time.

> aka @darkmastermindz (follow me on twitter) because that's the alias I picked back when I was a youngster.

I'm actually only twenty-something `(just like microservices that break apart what could be monolithic applications, there's microgenerations and I'm deemed a zillennial)`. I started and fall in love with software engineering when I was 5 years old and have been a polyglot programmer ever since. Some of my favorite programming languages include Python, Lua, C++, C#, SwiftLang, Kotlin, Java, Bash, and Typescript. My current areas of focus are in developer experience, interdiciplinary emerging tech, mentoring, and non-profit social good projects. :)

Signing this commit,
 ~ Hansel Wei <<hello@hanselwei.dev>>
