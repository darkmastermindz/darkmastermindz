👋🏻👀,

You Got Me at Hello World! 

I'm just your local friendly neighborhood Hansel. You know the one that loves the full stack development, datascience, automation, game dev, and communication aspects of science and emerging tech? I'm a huge extroverted geek that also loves hiking, rock climbing, gaming, and volunteering to contribute to projects for social good one commit at a time.

`aka @darkmastermindz (follow me on twitter) because that's the alias I picked back when I was a youngster.`

`Okay... you got me... I don't really talk like that:`

I'm actually only twenty-something, but I started and fell in love with programming when I was 5 years old and have been a polyglot programmer ever since. Some of my favorite programming languages include Python, R, C++, C#, SwiftLang, Kotlin, Java, Bash, and Typescript. :)`
