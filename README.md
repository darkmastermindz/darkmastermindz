Hello World! 

I'm your local friendly neighborhood Hansel. You know the one that loves the full stack, datascience, automation, and communication aspects of science and tech. I'm a huge extroverted geek that also loves hiking, rock climbing, and volunteering to contribute to projects for social good one commit at a time.
