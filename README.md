You Got Me at Hello World! 

I'm your local friendly neighborhood Hansel. You know the one that loves the full stack, datascience, automation, game dev, and communication aspects of science and emerging tech. I'm a huge extroverted geek that also loves hiking, rock climbing, gaming, and volunteering to contribute to projects for social good one commit at a time.

- aka @darkmastermindz (follow me on twitter) because that's the alias I picked back when I was a youngster.

Okay... you got me... I don't really talk like that.
